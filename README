## 🔠 Description

A computer process time consists of both I/O time and CPU time. To maximise the efficiency of the system, different scheduling algorithms can be implemented to schedule processes on the CPU.

This project implements 4 CPU-scheduling algoritms in xv6 operating system -
1. First Come First Serve: Schedules according to arrival times of processes. Timer interrupt was disabled.
2. Priority Scheduling (Preemptive): Highest priority process is given greater time quantum. If priorities of two processes match, then schedule according to arrival time. 
3. Multilevel Queue (Preemptive): Processes are placed in different queues. Only after completion of processes from top level queue, lower level queued processes are scheduled. Lower queue processes can suffer from starvation.
4. Multilevel Feedback Queue (Preemptive): If a process uses too much CPU time, it is moved to a lower-priority queue.

The time quantum was calculated using timer-interrupt and corresponding ticks. Calculation of ticks-count was adjusted according to timer interrupt duration to achieve uniformity.

Parameters such as turnaround time, throughput, waiting time were calculated.

NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

We don't process error reports (see note on top of this file).

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
